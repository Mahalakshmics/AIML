Two-player Solution-Based Crossword Puzzle: This crossword puzzle is a two-player game
where the points are awarded based on the character count in the word (Cat gets 3 points). The
player must choose one of the words given and correctly place it in the grid (For example, 5D
is Rabbit, 6A is cat ) . If the player places it in the wrong grid, then one point is deducted and
the other player has to place it in the grid till the right grid is found. The game continues till all
the words are placed correctly. Do not use Random seed and select two best solutions after 10
iterations. Print the final variable-value details.
